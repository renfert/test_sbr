If the result is a non-zero negative value, no further\n *       retry attempts will be made. The `base` option will be ignored if this\n *       option is supplied.\n *\n * @!attribute httpOptions\n *   @return [map] A set of options to pass to the low-level HTTP request.\n *     Currently supported options are:\n *\n *     * **proxy** [String] &mdash; the URL to proxy requests through\n *     * **agent** [http.Agent, https.Agent] &mdash; the Agent object to perform\n *       HTTP requests with. Used for connection pooling. Note that for\n *       SSL connections, a special Agent object is used in order to enable\n *       peer certificate verification. This feature is only supported in the\n *       Node.js environment.\n *     * **connectTimeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after\n *       failing to establish a connection with the server after\n *       `connectTimeout` milliseconds. This timeout has no effect once a socket\n *       connection has been established.\n *     * **timeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after timeout\n *       milliseconds of inactivity on the socket.

All requests made through the SDK are asynchronous and use a\n * callback interface. Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(error, response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.

If an IAM role is provided, the\n * {AWS.STS.assumeRole} operation will be used to fetch credentials for the\n * role instead.\n *\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials differs from AWS.TemporaryCredentials in\n * the way masterCredentials and refreshes are handled.\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials refreshes expired credentials using the\n * masterCredentials passed by the user to support chaining of STS credentials.\n * However, AWS.TemporaryCredentials recursively collapses the masterCredentials\n * during instantiation, precluding the ability to refresh credentials which\n * require intermediate, temporary credentials.\n *\n * For example, if the application should use RoleA, which must be assumed from\n * RoleB, and the environment provides credentials which can assume RoleB, then\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials must be used to support refreshing the\n * temporary credentials for RoleA:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var roleACreds = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: 'RoleA'},\n *   masterCredentials: new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *     params: {RoleArn: 'RoleB'},\n *     masterCredentials: new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS')\n *   })\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * If AWS.TemporaryCredentials had been used in the previous example,\n * `roleACreds` would fail to refresh because `roleACreds` would\n * use the environment credentials for the AssumeRole request.\n *\n * Another difference is that AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials creates the STS\n * service instance during instantiation while AWS.TemporaryCredentials creates\n * the STS service instance during the first refresh. Creating the service\n * instance during instantiation effectively captures the master credentials\n * from the global config, so that subsequent changes to the global config do\n * not affect the master credentials used to refresh the temporary credentials.\n *\n * This allows an instance of AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials to be assigned\n * to AWS.config.credentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var envCreds = new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS');\n * AWS.config.credentials = envCreds;\n * // masterCredentials will be envCreds\n * AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Similarly, to use the CredentialProviderChain's default providers as the\n * master credentials, simply create a new instance of\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials = new ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @!attribute service\n *   @return [AWS.STS] the STS service instance used to\n *     get and refresh temporary credentials from AWS STS.\n * @note (see constructor)\n */\nAWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new temporary credentials object.\n   *\n   * @param options [map] a set of options\n   * @option options params [map] ({}) a map of options that are passed to the\n   *   {AWS.STS.assumeRole} or {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operations.\n   *   If a `RoleArn` parameter is passed in, credentials will be based on the\n   *   IAM role.
