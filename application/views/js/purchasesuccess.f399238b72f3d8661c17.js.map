Possible values are: 'v2', 'v3', 'v4'.\n *\n * @!attribute signatureCache\n *   @return [Boolean] whether the signature to sign requests with (overriding\n *     the API configuration) is cached. Only applies to the signature version 'v4'.\n *     Defaults to `true`.\n *\n * @!attribute endpointDiscoveryEnabled\n *   @return [Boolean|undefined] whether to call operations with endpoints\n *     given by service dynamically. Setting this config to `true` will enable\n *     endpoint discovery for all applicable operations. Setting it to `false`\n *     will explicitly disable endpoint discovery even though operations that\n *     require endpoint discovery will presumably fail. Leaving it to\n *     `undefined` means SDK only do endpoint discovery when it's required.\n *     Defaults to `undefined`\n *\n * @!attribute endpointCacheSize\n *   @return [Number] the size of the global cache storing endpoints from endpoint\n *     discovery operations.

Defaults to 100 ms for all\n   *     services except DynamoDB, where it defaults to 50ms.\n   *   * **customBackoff ** [function] &mdash; A custom function that accepts a\n   *     retry count and error and returns the amount of time to delay in\n   *     milliseconds. If the result is a non-zero negative value, no further\n   *     retry attempts will be made. The `base` option will be ignored if this\n   *     option is supplied.\n   * @option options httpOptions [map] A set of options to pass to the low-level\n   *   HTTP request. Currently supported options are:\n   *\n   *   * **proxy** [String] &mdash; the URL to proxy requests through\n   *   * **agent** [http.Agent, https.Agent] &mdash; the Agent object to perform\n   *     HTTP requests with. Used for connection pooling. Defaults to the global\n   *     agent (`http.globalAgent`) for non-SSL connections. Note that for\n   *     SSL connections, a special Agent object is used in order to enable\n   *     peer certificate verification. This feature is only available in the\n   *     Node.js environment.\n   *   * **connectTimeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after\n   *     failing to establish a connection with the server after\n   *     `connectTimeout` milliseconds. This timeout has no effect once a socket\n   *     connection has been established.\n   *   * **timeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after timeout\n   *     milliseconds of inactivity on the socket. Defaults to two minutes\n   *     (120000).\n   *   * **xhrAsync** [Boolean] &mdash; Whether the SDK will send asynchronous\n   *     HTTP requests. Used in the browser environment only. Set to false to\n   *     send requests synchronously. Defaults to true (async on).\n   *   * **xhrWithCredentials** [Boolean] &mdash; Sets the \"withCredentials\"\n   *     property of an XMLHttpRequest object. Used in the browser environment\n   *     only. Defaults to false.\n   * @option options apiVersion [String, Date] a String in YYYY-MM-DD format\n   *   (or a date) that represents the latest possible API version that can be\n   *   used in all services (unless overridden by `apiVersions`). Specify\n   *   'latest' to use the latest possible version.\n   * @option options apiVersions [map<String, String|Date>] a map of service\n   *   identifiers (the lowercase service class name) with the API version to\n   *   use when instantiating a service. Specify 'latest' for each individual\n   *   that can use the latest available version.\n   * @option options logger [#write,#log] an object that responds to .write()\n   *   (like a stream) or .log() (like the console object) in order to log\n   *   information about requests\n   * @option options systemClockOffset [Number] an offset value in milliseconds\n   *   to apply to all signing times. Use this to compensate for clock skew\n   *   when your system may be out of sync with the service time. Note that\n   *   this configuration option can only be applied to the global `AWS.config`\n   *   object and cannot be overridden in service-specific configuration.\n   *   Defaults to 0 milliseconds.\n   * @option options signatureVersion [String] the signature version to sign\n   *   requests with (overriding the API configuration). Possible values are:\n   *   'v2', 'v3', 'v4'.\n   * @option options signatureCache [Boolean] whether the signature to sign\n   *   requests with (overriding the API configuration) is cached. Only applies\n   *   to the signature version 'v4'. Defaults to `true`.\n   * @option options dynamoDbCrc32 [Boolean] whether to validate the CRC32\n   *   checksum of HTTP response bodies returned by DynamoDB. Default: `true`.\n   * @option options useAccelerateEndpoint [Boolean] Whether to use the\n   *   S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint with the S3 service. Default: `false`.\n   * @option options clientSideMonitoring [Boolean] whether to collect and\n   *   publish this client's performance metrics of all its API requests.\n   * @option options endpointDiscoveryEnabled [Boolean|undefined] whether to\n   *   call operations with endpoints given by service dynamically. Setting this\n   * config to `true` will enable endpoint discovery for all applicable operations.\n   *   Setting it to `false` will explicitly disable endpoint discovery even though\n   *   operations that require endpoint discovery will presumably fail. Leaving it\n   *   to `undefined` means SDK will only do endpoint discovery when it's required.\n   *   Defaults to `undefined`\n   * @option options endpointCacheSize [Number] the size of the global cache storing\n   *   endpoints from endpoint discovery operations. Once endpoint cache is created,\n   *   updating this setting cannot change existing cache size.\n   *   Defaults to 1000\n   * @option options hostPrefixEnabled [Boolean] whether to marshal request\n   *   parameters to the prefix of hostname.\n   *   Defaults to `true`.\n   * @option options stsRegionalEndpoints ['legacy'|'regional'] whether to send sts request\n   *   to global endpoints or regional endpoints.\n   *   Defaults to 'legacy'.\n   */\n  constructor: function Config(options) {\n    if (options === undefined) options = {};\n    options = this.extractCredentials(options);\n\n    AWS.util.each.call(this, this.keys, function (key, value) {\n      this.set(key, options[key], value);\n    });\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * @!group Managing Credentials\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Loads credentials from the configuration object.

All requests made through the SDK are asynchronous and use a\n * callback interface. Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(error, response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.

where possible. This abstraction also enables uploading\n * streams of unknown size due to the use of multipart uploads.\n *\n * To construct a managed upload object, see the {constructor} function.\n *\n * ## Tracking upload progress\n *\n * The managed upload object can also track progress by attaching an\n * 'httpUploadProgress' listener to the upload manager. This event is similar\n * to {AWS.Request~httpUploadProgress} but groups all concurrent upload progress\n * into a single event. See {AWS.S3.ManagedUpload~httpUploadProgress} for more\n * information.\n *\n * ## Handling Multipart Cleanup\n *\n * By default, this class will automatically clean up any multipart uploads\n * when an individual part upload fails. This behavior can be disabled in order\n * to manually handle failures by setting the `leavePartsOnError` configuration\n * option to `true` when initializing the upload object.\n *\n * @!event httpUploadProgress(progress)\n *   Triggered when the uploader has uploaded more data.\n *   @note The `total` property may not be set if the stream being uploaded has\n *     not yet finished chunking. In this case the `total` will be undefined\n *     until the total stream size is known.\n *   @note This event will not be emitted in Node.js 0.8.x.\n *   @param progress [map] An object containing the `loaded` and `total` bytes\n *     of the request and the `key` of the S3 object. Note that `total` may be undefined until the payload\n *     size is known.\n *   @context (see AWS.Request~send)\n */\nAWS.S3.ManagedUpload = AWS.util.inherit({\n  /**\n   * Creates a managed upload object with a set of configuration options.\n   *\n   * @note A \"Body\" parameter is required to be set prior to calling {send}.\n   * @note In Node.js, sending \"Body\" as {https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode object-mode stream}\n   *   may result in upload hangs.

Without any\n * extra parameters, credentials will be fetched from the\n * {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operation. If an IAM role is provided, the\n * {AWS.STS.assumeRole} operation will be used to fetch credentials for the\n * role instead.\n *\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials differs from AWS.TemporaryCredentials in\n * the way masterCredentials and refreshes are handled.\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials refreshes expired credentials using the\n * masterCredentials passed by the user to support chaining of STS credentials.\n * However, AWS.TemporaryCredentials recursively collapses the masterCredentials\n * during instantiation, precluding the ability to refresh credentials which\n * require intermediate, temporary credentials.\n *\n * For example, if the application should use RoleA, which must be assumed from\n * RoleB, and the environment provides credentials which can assume RoleB, then\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials must be used to support refreshing the\n * temporary credentials for RoleA:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var roleACreds = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: 'RoleA'},\n *   masterCredentials: new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *     params: {RoleArn: 'RoleB'},\n *     masterCredentials: new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS')\n *   })\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * If AWS.TemporaryCredentials had been used in the previous example,\n * `roleACreds` would fail to refresh because `roleACreds` would\n * use the environment credentials for the AssumeRole request.\n *\n * Another difference is that AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials creates the STS\n * service instance during instantiation while AWS.TemporaryCredentials creates\n * the STS service instance during the first refresh. Creating the service\n * instance during instantiation effectively captures the master credentials\n * from the global config, so that subsequent changes to the global config do\n * not affect the master credentials used to refresh the temporary credentials.\n *\n * This allows an instance of AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials to be assigned\n * to AWS.config.credentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var envCreds = new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS');\n * AWS.config.credentials = envCreds;\n * // masterCredentials will be envCreds\n * AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Similarly, to use the CredentialProviderChain's default providers as the\n * master credentials, simply create a new instance of\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials = new ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @!attribute service\n *   @return [AWS.STS] the STS service instance used to\n *     get and refresh temporary credentials from AWS STS.\n * @note (see constructor)\n */\nAWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new temporary credentials object.\n   *\n   * @param options [map] a set of options\n   * @option options params [map] ({}) a map of options that are passed to the\n   *   {AWS.STS.assumeRole} or {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operations.\n   *   If a `RoleArn` parameter is passed in, credentials will be based on the\n   *   IAM role.
